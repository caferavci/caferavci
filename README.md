# Hi, I'm Cafer 👋

<strong>Enthusiastic on R&D autonomous vehicles and traffic simulation.</strong>

I strive while utilising both the logical and creative part of the brain. I feel most in my place while continuously operating in these roles as a front-end developer within a team. I stand for quality, innovation and building useful products with a focus on the human using the product. I am a proactive, confident and communicatively strong person always looking ahead in the future.

## YouTube 🎥
I publish a new YouTube video on the Frontmen channel with front-end tips every Friday. You can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewtT4NJX6NA&list=PLsES66lgcKHD9oRnyN3PEvyTjWXJF4IgT)!
